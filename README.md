# Hello, I'm Jack ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer programmer and technical writer from the UK. 

I like to make software that can be useful or fun for myself or others. I also enjoy exploring how computers and technology work, and write about it on my [blog](https://jacksmith.xyz).

If you would like to work with me or just say hi, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:jacksmithxyz@protonmail.com).
